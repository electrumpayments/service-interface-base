The [swagger (Open API)](http://swagger.io) definition of the interface specification can be found [here](/specification/swagger/swagger.yaml), as well as below.

Many tools are available for processing swagger files, and using a code generation tool to create a boilerplate client or server can be an excellent starting point for development. We highly recommend looking at [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for a generator in your preferred language when starting out.
